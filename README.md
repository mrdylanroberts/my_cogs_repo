- **Features**:
  - Fully configurable through Discord commands
  - Customizable channel IDs and role names
  - Admin-only configuration commands
  - Settings display with Discord embeds

## Important Notes

- The cog requires the following permissions:
  - Manage Roles
  - Read Messages
  - Send Messages
  - Add Reactions
  - Read Message History
- The bot's role must be higher in the hierarchy than the roles it will manage
- Configuration commands can be accessed using `!rolecleanup` or the shorter alias `!rc`
- The cog will not process reactions until both channels are configured
