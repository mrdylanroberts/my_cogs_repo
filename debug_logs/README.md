### Flexible Command Chaining

The cog now supports flexible command chaining for even more powerful filtering:

```
# Using the chain command
!debuglogs chain emailnews errors recent 5    # Get emailnews cog errors from last 5 hours
!debuglogs chain admin warnings 30m          # Get admin cog warnings from last 30 minutes
!debuglogs chain errors 1h                   # Get all errors from last hour
!debuglogs chain mycog "connection timeout"   # Search for specific text in mycog logs

# Direct chaining (auto-detected)
!debuglogs emailnews errors recent 5         # Same as above, without 'chain' keyword
!debuglogs admin warnings 30m               # Direct syntax support
```

**Supported Filter Types:**
- **Cog names**: Any cog name (e.g., `emailnews`, `admin`, `modlog`)
- **Log levels**: `errors`, `warnings` (and variations like `error`, `warn`)
- **Time specifications**: `5m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, etc.
- **Recent with count**: `recent` followed by a number (hours)
- **Search terms**: Quoted strings for text search

**Filter Order**: Filters can be specified in any order and will be applied intelligently.

## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Add this repository to your Red-DiscordBot:
   ```
   !repo add debug-logs <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the cog:
   ```
   !cog install debug-logs debug_logs
   ```

3. Load the cog:
   ```
   !load debug_logs
   ```

### üÜï Ubuntu VPS Setup

For enhanced Ubuntu VPS features, run the automated setup script:

```bash
# Navigate to the cog directory
cd ~/.local/share/Red-DiscordBot/cogs/debug_logs/

# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x ubuntu_setup.sh

# Run the setup script
./ubuntu_setup.sh
```

Or follow the manual setup guide in [README_UBUNTU.md](README_UBUNTU.md).

**Ubuntu VPS Features Include:**
- systemd journal integration
- System resource monitoring
- Service status checking
- Enhanced security features
- Google Cloud Platform optimizations

4. Ensure the bot has proper file system permissions to read log files.

5. Configure default settings (optional):
   ```
   [p]debuglogs config channel #admin-logs
   [p]debuglogs config maxsize 8
   ```

## Log File Detection

The cog automatically searches for Red-DiscordBot log files in common locations:

- `./logs/red.log`
- `./red.log`
- `~/.local/share/Red-DiscordBot/logs/red.log`
- `/var/log/red-discordbot/red.log`
- `C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Red-DiscordBot\logs\red.log`

If none of these paths exist, it will search for any `.log` files containing "red" in the current directory and `./logs/` directory.

## Permissions Required

- **Basic Commands**: Manage Guild permission or Moderator role
- **Configuration Commands**: Administrator permission

## File Size Handling

- Discord has file upload limits (8MB for regular users, 50MB for Nitro)
- Large files are automatically truncated with a warning
- Configurable maximum file size per guild
- Files are sent with timestamps in the filename for easy organization

## Use Cases

### Real-time Debugging
```
!debuglogs 5m          # Quick check of recent activity
!debuglogs 30m         # Last 30 minutes for broader context
!debuglogs 1h          # Last hour for comprehensive review
!debuglogs 2h          # Extended troubleshooting period
!debuglogs minutes 45  # Custom 45-minute window
```

### Cog-specific Troubleshooting
```
!debuglogs cog modlog     # Check moderation logs
!debuglogs cog economy   # Review economy cog issues
!debuglogs cog automod   # Automod-related problems
```

### Combined Filtering (Advanced) ‚≠ê
```
!debuglogs cogtime admin 5m      # Admin cog issues in last 5 minutes
!debuglogs cogerrors economy     # All economy cog errors
!debuglogs timeerrors 1h         # All errors in the last hour
!debuglogs cogwarnings modlog    # Modlog warnings only
```

### Error Investigation
```
!debuglogs errors        # All recent errors
!debuglogs warnings      # Warning messages
!debuglogs search "timeout"  # Find timeout-related issues
```

### Sending to Specific Channels
```
!debuglogs recent #admin-logs     # Send to admin channel
!debuglogs errors #error-reports  # Route errors to specific channel
```

### Performance Monitoring
```
!debuglogs config cache 300      # Enable 5-minute caching
!debuglogs config ratelimit 3    # Limit to 3 commands per minute
!debuglogs config maxresults 500 # Limit search results
```

## Security & Performance

### Security Features
- **Permission Control**: Only administrators and users with "Manage Guild" permission can use commands
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents access to files outside allowed directories
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits prevent command spam and resource abuse
- **Audit Logging**: All command usage is logged for security monitoring
- **Safe File Handling**: Validates file types and paths before processing
- **Privacy Protection**: Log files sent as attachments, not displayed in chat

### Performance Optimizations
- **Intelligent Caching**: Frequently accessed log data is cached for faster retrieval
- **Smart Truncation**: Large files are intelligently truncated while preserving context
- **Background Processing**: Heavy operations don't block other bot functions
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of cache and temporary data
- **Efficient Filtering**: Optimized algorithms for fast log processing

### Best Practices
- Enable caching for frequently accessed logs
- Set appropriate rate limits based on server size
- Use combined filters to reduce processing overhead
- Monitor audit logs for unusual usage patterns
- Regular configuration reviews for optimal performance

## Troubleshooting

### Log File Not Found
- Ensure Red-DiscordBot is configured to write logs
- Check that the bot has read permissions for the log directory
- Verify log file locations in your Red installation
- Check the allowed log paths in configuration

### Performance Issues
- Enable caching: `!debuglogs config cache 300`
- Reduce search results: `!debuglogs config maxresults 500`
- Use more specific filters to reduce processing load
- Check rate limiting settings if commands are slow

### Large File Issues
- Adjust the `maxsize` setting if files are too large
- Use time-based filtering to reduce file size
- Consider using `tail` command for recent entries only
- Enable smart truncation for better context preservation

### Rate Limiting Issues
- Check current limits: `!debuglogs config show`
- Adjust limits: `!debuglogs config ratelimit <number>`
- Wait for rate limit reset (1 minute)
- Use caching to reduce repeated requests

### Permission Errors
- Ensure the bot has proper file system permissions
- Check Discord permissions for file uploads in the target channel
- Verify admin permissions for configuration commands

### Cache Issues
- Clear cache: `!debuglogs config cache 0` then re-enable
- Check cache duration settings
- Monitor memory usage if cache is too large

### Timezone Problems
- Set correct timezone: `!debuglogs config timezone <your_timezone>`
- Verify supported timezone list in configuration
- Check log timestamp formats are recognized
