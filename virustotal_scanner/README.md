## Setup

### 1. Get a VirusTotal API Key

1. Visit [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to your profile and copy your API key

### 2. Install the Cog

```
[p]load virustotal_scanner
```

### 3. Configure the API Key

```
[p]virustotal apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

**Note**: The message containing your API key will be automatically deleted for security.

## Commands

### Admin Commands (Requires Manage Server permission)

- `[p]virustotal` - Show help for VirusTotal commands
- `[p]virustotal apikey <key>` - Set the VirusTotal API key
- `[p]virustotal toggle [true/false]` - Enable/disable automatic scanning
- `[p]virustotal settings` - Show current configuration
- `[p]virustotal scan <url_or_hash>` - Manually scan a URL or file hash

## Configuration Options

The cog stores the following settings per server:

- **API Key**: Your VirusTotal API key
- **Auto Scan**: Enable/disable automatic scanning (default: enabled)
- **Scan URLs**: Scan URLs in messages (default: enabled)
- **Scan Files**: Scan file attachments (default: enabled)
- **Whitelist Channels**: Only scan in these channels (empty = all channels)
- **Blacklist Channels**: Never scan in these channels
- **Min Detections**: Minimum detections to trigger warnings (default: 1)
- **Delete Malicious**: Auto-delete malicious content (default: disabled)
- **Notify Admins**: Send notifications to admins about threats (default: enabled)
- **Scan Delay**: Delay between scans in seconds (default: 2)

## How It Works

### Automatic Scanning

1. **Message Monitoring**: The cog listens to all messages in configured channels
2. **URL Detection**: Uses regex to find URLs in message content
3. **File Detection**: Checks for file attachments
4. **Queue Processing**: Adds scan requests to a queue with rate limiting
5. **API Requests**: Submits URLs/files to VirusTotal for analysis
6. **Result Processing**: Displays results in formatted embeds
7. **Threat Handling**: Takes action based on detection results

### Scan Results

- **‚úÖ Clean**: 0 detections - content is safe
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious**: 1-4 detections - potentially risky
- **üö® Malicious**: 5+ detections - likely dangerous

### Rate Limiting

The cog respects VirusTotal's free API limits:
- 4 requests per minute
- 15-second delay between scans
- Queue system to handle multiple requests

## Security Features

### Automatic Protection
- Real-time scanning of all content
- Immediate threat detection
- Optional auto-deletion of malicious content
- Admin notifications for security incidents

### Privacy & Security
- API keys are stored securely in bot config
- Messages containing API keys are auto-deleted

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup
```
# Set API key
!virustotal apikey vt_api_key_here

# Check settings
!virustotal settings

# Enable auto-scanning
!virustotal toggle true
```

### Manual Scanning
```
# Scan a URL
!virustotal scan https://suspicious-website.com

# Scan a file hash
!virustotal scan d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# These settings are stored in the bot's config system
# and can be modified through the Red-DiscordBot config commands

# Example: Set minimum detections to 3
[p]set guild virustotal_scanner min_detections 3

# Example: Enable auto-deletion
[p]set guild virustotal_scanner delete_malicious true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No API key configured"**
   - Solution: Set your VirusTotal API key using `[p]virustotal apikey`

2. **"Scan failed"**
   - Check your API key is valid
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded rate limits
   - Verify the URL/file is accessible

3. **"No results found"**
   - The file/URL hasn't been scanned before
   - Wait a few minutes and try again
   - Some content may not be scannable

### Rate Limit Issues

If you're hitting rate limits:
- Increase the scan delay in settings
- Consider upgrading to a paid VirusTotal account
- Reduce the number of channels being monitored

## API Limits

### Free Account
- 4 requests per minute
- 500 requests per day
- 15,500 requests per month

### Paid Accounts
Consider upgrading for higher limits if you have a large server.
